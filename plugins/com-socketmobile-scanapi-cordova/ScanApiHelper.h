/**
 * this class provides a set of common functions to retrieve
 * or configure a scanner or ScanAPI and to receive decoded
 * data from a scanner.<p>
 * This helper manages a commands list so the application
 * can send multiple command in a row, the helper will send
 * them one at a time. Each command has an optional callback
 * function that will be called each time a command complete.
 * By example, to get a device friendly name, use the
 * PostGetFriendlyName method and pass a callback function in
 * which you can update the UI with the newly fetched friendly
 * name. This operation will be completely asynchronous.<p>
 * ScanAPI Helper manages a list of device information. Most of
 * the time only one device is connected to the host. This list
 * could be configured to have always one item, that will be a
 * "No device connected" item in the case where there is no device
 * connected, or simply a device name when there is one device
 * connected. Use isDeviceConnected method to know if there is at
 * least one device connected to the host.<br>
 * Common usage scenario of ScanAPIHelper:<br>
 * <li> create an instance of ScanApiHelper: _scanApi=new ScanApiHelper();
 * <li> [optional] if a UI device list is used a no device connected
 * string can be specified:_scanApi.setNoDeviceText(getString(R.string.no_device_connected));
 * <li> register for notification: _scanApi.setDelegate(_scanApiNotification);
 * <li> derive from ScanApiHelperNotification to handle the notifications coming
 * from ScanAPI including "Device Arrival", "Device Removal", "Decoded Data" etc...
 * <li> open ScanAPI to start using it:_scanApi.open();
 * <li> check the ScanAPI initialization result in the notifications:
 * _scanApiNotification.onScanApiInitializeComplete(long result){}
 * <li> monitor a scanner connection by using the notifications:
 * _scanApiNotification.onDeviceArrival(long result,DeviceInfo newDevice){}
 * _scanApiNotification.onDeviceRemoval(DeviceInfo deviceRemoved){}
 * <li> retrieve the decoded data from a scanner
 * _scanApiNotification.onDecodedData(DeviceInfo device,ISktScanDecodedData decodedData){}
 * <li> once the application is done using ScanAPI, close it using:
 * _scanApi.close();
